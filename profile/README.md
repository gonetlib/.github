## Gonetlib

Gonetlib is the short name for **Golang Network Library**.

In this organization, we currently maintains 2 repositories:

- [go-engine.io](https://github.com/gonetlib/go-engine.io) 
- [go-socket.io](https://github.com/gonetlib/go-socket.io) 

And in the furture, we will maintain/create more network library for golang, for example:

- some high performance lower level common libraries
- some high performance application level libraries
- some high performance application level frameworks
- some uncommon network protocol library.

### Principle

Currently, we're maintaining some library in this organization, for example socket.io protocol. But as we know, some common protocol have official organization, and as we make our library stronge enough, we will contacts with the official orgainzation, and let them take over the library and continue to maintain it.
